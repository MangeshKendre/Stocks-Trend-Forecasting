# Stocks Trend Forecasting

ðŸ“ˆ **Project Overview:**

Excited to share my latest project on Stocks Trend Forecasting! This project utilizes the Yahoo Finance API for live stock data, covering records from 1996 to 15th January 2024. The core of the project involves training an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for accurate stock price forecasting.

## ðŸ“Š Key Highlights:

- **Data Exploration:** Describing the dataset and visualizing trends over time.
  
- **Live API Integration:** Real-time stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance API for up-to-date analysis.

- **LSTM Model Training:** Employing deep learning techniques to capture complex patterns in the stock data.

- **Interactive Visualization:** Engaging charts illustrating Open Price vs Time, Open Price vs 100 days MA vs 200 days MA, and the comparison of Actual vs Forecasted Stock Prices on Test data.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used:

- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras.
  
- **Web Scraping:** Utilizing the Yahoo Finance API for live stock data.

- **Interactive Dashboards:** Streamlit for dynamic and interactive data visualization.

## ðŸ”— Interactive Demo:

Check out the interactive demo on [Streamlit](#link-to-your-streamlit-app).

## ðŸ¤– Model Training:

The LSTM model is trained on a portion of the live data and tested on the remaining. Continuous learning ensures the model adapts to real-time market dynamics.

## ðŸ“ˆ Continuous Learning:

This project is an ongoing endeavor, exploring ways to enhance the model's accuracy and incorporate real-time predictions.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure:

- **`app.py`:** The main Streamlit application file.
  
- **`model_training.ipynb`:** Jupyter Notebook detailing the LSTM model training process.
